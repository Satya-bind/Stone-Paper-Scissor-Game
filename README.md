## 🔧 How It Works

1. **User Choice**: Click on any of the three options - Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. **Computer Choice**: The computer randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. **Result**:
   - **Win**: Your choice beats the computer's choice.
   - **Loss**: The computer's choice beats yours.
   - **Draw**: Both choices are the same.
4. **Score Update**: Scores are updated dynamically, and the result message appears with a background color:
   - Green for win
   - Red for loss
   - Grey for a draw.
